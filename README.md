# Graph-theory-project
This is a project that tries to implement some concepts in graph theory. The user input a graph, and there is a variety of functions that allow the user to tell some of its properties, including its connectivity, calculating adjacency matrices, among others.

There is an example that explains the step by step guide of the application. Essentially, the user first defines a set of edges and uses it as an input for its graph.
The user also defines many of the graph properties, such as if the graph is directed, a multigraph, among others. Once these are defined, the edges are filtered to fit this description.

Once this is done, the user can determine different graph properties, some of which are given in the example. This includes getting the adjacency matrix, determining possible paths from one edge to the other, connectivity, etc.

Future versions of the code might implement graph algorithms, like the Dijkstra, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.
